# Simple Linear Regression
#### The Dataset is a years of experience vs Salary data. I used simple linear regression algorithm to train the model and ploted the best fit line that predicts the salary given a year of experience.

#### Libraries Used: Pandas, SciKit Learn, Pyplot from matplotlib

#### Steps Involved:

#### 1) Importing the dataset
#### 2 ) Spliting the Dataset into training and testing data set
#### 3) Training the linear regression model with the training data set
#### 4) Predicting the testing set
#### 5) Visualising the training set
#### 6) Visualising the testing set
